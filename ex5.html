      On the launch of the new <strong>Jawa 42 FJ</strong> motorcycle, Mahindra
      emphasised that a brand is defined by its stories. The new model is priced
      starting at <ins>&#8377;1.99 lakh</ins>. “Brands are built from stories –
      why they were created, how they evolved, and how they continue to grow.
      Revived brands, like Jawa, also tell new stories,”
      <em>Mahindra</em> noted.
